                      The question is.. "How many realize they CAN stretch wings?" At some point of time in life, many of us alter the destination due to a missing help!
                      Be it Health, Education, Lifestyle or Path finder (Career Guidance), WE, the HELPers, believe in fulfilling this gap & enable people to resume their journeys!`

                      Be it sudden or chronic, we have seen where a family lands when a family member requires medical help.

                      Many have the virtue of educated parents and/or relatives but we wish to be the source & direction for the rest. 
                      We, the HELPers, visit rural schools, conduct career orientation programs at the schools for Classes IX & X, explain our personal experiences and distribute hand books that have all possible paths after class-X, XII etc. for ITI, to Teacher, Doctor, Engineer and many more.`
